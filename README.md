# Block-Run

A game meant to be an endless runner like Temple Run but turned out to be more of a Subway Surfer type of game.

As of the moment, it only features simple graphics consisting of 2D blocks of varying colors. It has a simple UI and has you the player dodging prefabs of blocks that are already arranged in formation. The blocks spawn every 2 seconds and gets faster and spawns more frequently as the game progresses.
